*** NOTE ***
For the algebra.html file only the "change of subject" question works.& for this one 
You MUST give your answer to the generated question in Latex format

for eg. to rearrange s=2z+3
the correct answer in maths form: z=(s-3)/2 (IT WONT ACCEPT THIS)
the correct answer in Latex form: (s-3)/2 (THIS IS CORRECT ANSWER)

or for u=9z^3+5
the correct answer in Latex form: ((u-5)/9)^(1/3)

This project is to help students revise maths questions by giving them instant solutions to any question
